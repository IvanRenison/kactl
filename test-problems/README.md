Test of contents in problems of online judges

Each file should start with:
```cpp
// Problem: Link_to_problem
// Status: Accepted (or in other branches may be something else)
```

In the part of the file in witch the content is used, should be surrounded with comments:
```cpp
/// content/folder/file.h
content
...
/// END content
```

If some part is different from the original (e.g. modified operations) it should be surrounded with comments:
```cpp
/// START diff
Different part
/// END diff
```
