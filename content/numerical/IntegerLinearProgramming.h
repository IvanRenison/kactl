 * Description: When $A$ and $b$ have all integer entries and $A$ is totally unimodular then
 * every basic feasible solution is integral so the simplex algorithm can be used to solve ILP.
 * A matrix $A$ is totally unimodular if every square submatrix of $A$ has determinant $0$, $1$ or $-1$.
 * Details: Is there some time guarantee for this?
 * Status: untested
