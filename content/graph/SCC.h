 * Description: Finds strongly connected components in a
 * directed graph. If vertices $u, v$ belong to the same component,
 * we can reach $u$ from $v$ and vice versa.
 * Usage: scc(adj) returns the number of components and the component of each vertex.
 * Natural order of components is reverse topological order (a component only has edges
 * to components with lower index).
 * Time: O(E + V)
 * Status: stress-tested against old implementation
